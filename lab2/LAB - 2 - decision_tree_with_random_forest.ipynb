    "## 2. Theoretical Aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Decision Tree Algorithm is an information-based model in machine learning used for both classification and regression tasks (Classification in this lab). It is constructed based on an **information metric**, which is why it is referred to as an information-based model.\n",
    "> In a Decision Tree, the model is structured as a hierarchy of nodes and arcs. Three types of nodes can be distinguished:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">> - ***Root node***: The first node in the tree, containing the entire dataset.\n",
    ">> - ***Interior nodes***: Intermediate nodes that help in decision-making but do not provide final classifications themselves.\n",
    ">> - ***Leaf nodes***: Terminal nodes without children that serve as decision nodes, providing the final classification or regression output.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Process\n",
    ">The process invovle the following steps:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. Compute the information gain for each feature (**column**) in the dataset.\n",
    ">2. Select the **feature** with the **highest** information gain.\n",
    ">3. Split the dataset based on the **selected feature**, creating subsets for each **unique value** of that feature.\n",
    ">4. Recursively repeat this process for each subset, considering only the **remaining features** at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Node Structure\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Each node in the tree contains the following **attributes**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">***\n",
    ">- Dataset Sample: A subset of the dataset (for the root node, it contains the entire dataset), divided into **features** and **target** values (**vectors**).\n",
    ">- Decision Label: The most **frequent class label** in the dataset sample.\n",
    ">- Feature (**Column**): The feature used for splitting at that node.\n",
    ">- Depth: The level of the node within the tree.\n",
    ">- Subsets (**Children Nodes**): The resulting subsets after splitting, stored as a dictionary of nodes\n",

    ">### Information gain metric\n",
    "\n",
    ">As mentioned earlier, Decision Trees use the Information Gain metric to determine the best feature for splitting the dataset and constructing nodes and leaves. To implement this metric effectively, it is essential to first understand its formula, meaning, and working mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Information Gain measures the amount of information obtained about the target variable when splitting the dataset based on a particular feature. It quantifies how much uncertainty (entropy) is **reduced** by considering that **feature**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The uncertainty (or impurity) in the dataset is measured using Entropy, which is calculated as the weighted sum of the logarithms of the probabilities of each possible outcome (**class label**). In other words, entropy quantifies how impure or random the dataset is before and after a split.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The entropy formula is given by:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> H(t) = − ∑ (P(t = i) × logs(P(t = i)))\n",
